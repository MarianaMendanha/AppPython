## Description :page_facing_up:

AppPython is a back-end application developed during the Rocketseat NLW Unite event. It's built entirely in Python using Flask, focusing on delivering a back-end solution for web applications. This project demonstrates best practices in Python development, including clean code, application structure, and integrations with external services. The application is designed for event registration and check-in, leveraging SQLite as the database.
